PROJECTS

Hospital Management System:

Created a hospital management system using C, allowing for the creation and management of patient
records. The system can take entries of patients and efficiently search patient history in the records.
Developed functions for adding, searching, and displaying patient information, ensuring efficient data
handling and retrieval. Technologies used: C.

Flower Fairy Web Project

Flower Fairy Web Project: Designed and implemented an interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Developed a dynamic user interface for displaying information about various flowers, incorporating
animations and responsive design principles. Utilized JavaScript for client-side preprocessing to enhance user
experience and interactivity. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Skills gained: web development,
responsive design, client-side scripting, UI/UX design


Machine Learning Hybrid Model Project:

Developed a hybrid model integrating Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers to enhance accuracy in heart
disease prediction. Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values and
encoding categorical features. Combined Naive Bayes probabilities with training data for improved Decision Tree
performance and augmented test data for accurate predictions. Visualized classifier accuracies using matplotlib,
achieving a significant improvement in predictive accuracy. Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn,
Matplotlib. Skills gained: hybrid modeling, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, data
visualization.
